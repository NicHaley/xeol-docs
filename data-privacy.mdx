### What are we doing to protect your data?
We are a **security-first** team coming from some of the most security focused companies (International banks, Datadog, etc). We do not take any data we hold on your behalf lightly.

ðŸ”’ Xeol only has access to metadata on the software used in your builds.

ðŸ”’ Xeol is OSS that you can [audit](https://github.com/xeol-io/xeol) as you see fit.

ðŸ”’ Xeol encrypts all data at rest with AWS RDS encryption using industry-standard AES-256 algorithm.

ðŸ”’ Xeol only sends data over TLS 1.2 or greater.

ðŸ”’ Xeol will remove all your company data within 3 months of end of service. This can be expedited if you message us at `privacy@xeol.io`


### Concerns?
If you still have any concerns on the data that we are holding on your behalf, please message us at `privacy@xeol.io`
