## Xeol Dashboard

**Step 1.** Get Access to the Xeol Dashboard

You will recieve an email invite to the Xeol dashboard.

<br />

**Step 2.** Get API key

Under the Settings tab, you will be able to generate an API Key.

<br />

**Step 3.** Add Xeol CLI to your CI

With you API key, you can now add Xeol scanning to your CI system. After you've built an image,
you can scan it with Xeol.

```bash azure-pipeline.yml
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeol-io/xeol/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
xeol $(repository):$(tag) --api-key=$(XEOL_API_KEY)
```

This will send EOL data about your builds back to the Xeol dashboard.

<br />

**Step 4.** Create EOL policies in the Dashboard

Now that you have data about your builds, you can create EOL policies in the dashboard.
You can set a policy to WARN or DENY on a matching EOL Product.

In the case of a DENY policy, if a build contains a product that is EOL, the build
will exit with a non-zero exit code and fail the pipeline.
