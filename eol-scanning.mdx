## Xeol Dashboard

**Step 1.** Get Access to Xeol

You will receive an invite in the mail to access your Xeol dashboard.

<br />

**Step 2.** Get API key

Under the Settings tab, you will be able to generate an API Key.

<br />

**Step 3.** Add Xeol CLI to your CI

Add the following command to whichever CI script to start scanning.

```bash azure-pipeline.yml
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeol-io/xeol/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
xeol $(repository):$(tag) --api-key=$(XEOL_API_KEY)
```

<br />

**Step 4.** Create EOL policies 

Once Xeol is setup to scan your builds, it will report its results back to your Xeol dashboard where you will be able to create policies to warn or block builds.
