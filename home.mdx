## What is Xeol?
<Tip>Pronounced Zee-OL. Like EOL (end-of-life) but with a Z in front ðŸ˜›</Tip>

Xeol helps you **identify** and **perform** all your critical infrastructure upgrades like Kubernetes and Postgres.

We know that these upgrades are never fun to do but nevertheless critical and necessary.

So we built automation around Postgres upgrades to make sure you have the fullest **confidence** when switching traffic over on production without investing weeks in due dilligence!

## Who are we?
We are two technical founders who have lived and felt the pains of infrastructure teams. We are building Xeol to help our fellow infrastructure engineers automate the mundane and risky tasks so they can remain focused on enabling their product enigneering teams. If you want to chat with us feel free to shoot us a message at `founders@xeol.io`.
