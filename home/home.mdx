## What is Xeol?
<Tip>Pronounced Zee-O-L. Like EOL (end-of-life) but with a Z in front.</Tip>

Xeol helps secure your software from **build** to **deploy**.

Secure software is not just one that is free of known vulnerabilities but **produced** and **deployed** in a secured way.

## Who are we?
We are two technical [founders](https://www.xeol.io/about-us) who met during the founding stages of an AI ðŸ¦„. We have worked with each for 5 years in the backend, infrastucture, devOps, and security space. If you want to chat with us feel free to shoot us a message at `founders@xeol.io`.
